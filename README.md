This project is an experiment based off a tutorial from a magazine. I saw an interesting tutorial on adding drop shadows to a 3D menu to make it seem more real, and I thought it would be interesting to build a navbar that would swipe in and out using a CSS3D transition. I'm building it on rails in case I come up with a better use for it and because I felt a little rusty. This should be interesting!
